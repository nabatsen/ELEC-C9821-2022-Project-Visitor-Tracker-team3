# DTAP_team3

## Getting started

# Design concept

Problem: hosts want to know how many people visit their exhibition. In addition, they would also like to collect more fine-grained data to understand which parts of the exhibition are the most popular and how visitor numbers change with time

Typical Solution: curators keeping track of visitors behavior while leading the excursions / observing the exhibition and analyzing the data by themselves

Our Solution: build the system consisting of device keeping track of peopleâ€™s movements around the exhibition, backend storing and analyzing the data, and web interface to display the results to the user

# Technologies

We are using computer vision technologies (OpenVINO framework) to capture and process the video data, Node JS for web server and vanilla Javascript for the web application.

## Run the application

# First, start the back-end server

```
cd dtap_team3
cd statAPI
npm run dev
```
